This is CDI Advocate repository.
Currently it hosts CDI beanContainer.
CDI beanContainer is a small wrapper around Caucho Resin Candi  and JBoss Seam Weld.
It should be the basis of adding unit tests framework that works with all CDI implementations.

Apache OpenWebBean support is planned.
We are looking for someone to do the OpenWebBeans work.
